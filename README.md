It is the most fundamental of all the network flow problems. \
The problem is easy to state: we wish to determine a least-cost shipment of a commodity through a network in order to satisfy demands at certain nodes from available supplies at other nodes. `
This model has a number of familiar applications: the distribution of a product from manufacturing plants to the warehouse, or from warehouse to retailers; the flow of raw material and intermediate goods through the various machining stations in a production line; the routing of automobiles through an urban street network; and the routing of calls through the telephone system.
